# lmh01_pathfinding_rs
My try at writing pathfinding algorithms in rust.

## Algorithms
The following algorithms are currently available in this library:

- **[Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)**
- **[Bellman-Ford algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman%E2%80%93Ford_algorithm)**

For more details run `cargo doc --open` and take a look at the documentation.

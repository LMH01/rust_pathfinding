# lmh01_pathfinding_rs
My try at writing pathfinding algorithms in rust.

This project has been replaced by [simple_graph_algorithms](https://github.com/LMH01/simple_graph_algorithms).
The new project has been created to clean up the project and make it fit for submission to [crates.io](https://crates.io), further development will be done there.

## Algorithms
The following algorithms are currently available in this library:

- **[Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)**
- **[Bellman-Ford algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman%E2%80%93Ford_algorithm)**

For more details run `cargo doc --open` and take a look at the documentation.
